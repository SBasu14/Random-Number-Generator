# ðŸ’¡Random Number Generator - Two ways!

A comprehensive project demonstrating different approaches to random number generation, featuring both IoT-based hardware implementation using NodeMCU-32 (ESP32) and a web-based application.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This repository demonstrates two distinct approaches to generating random numbers, each with its own advantages and use cases:

- Hardware/IoT Approach - Using NodeMCU-32 (ESP32) microcontroller for embedded random number generation with cloud integration.

- Software/Web Approach - Browser-based application for instant random number generation.

### Method 1: IoT-Based Random Number Generator

**Platform: NodeMCU-32 (ESP32)**

**Language: C/C++ (Arduino)**

**Features:**

- Hardware-based random number generation with true RNG
- WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity
- Cloud integration (ThingSpeak)
- Real-time data logging and visualization
- Suitable for embedded systems and IoT applications

### Method 2: Web Application

**Platform: Web Browser**

**Language: HTML, CSS, JavaScript**

**Features:**

- Instant random number generation
- Customizable range (min/max values)
- Support for decimal numbers
- Generate single or multiple numbers
- Unique number generation option
- No installation required
